1. Follow instructions 'LoadImage.pdf' to burn the correct image on the SD card.

(You can find an image in the /Images folder)


2. Flashing eMMC [can take up to ~15min]
To set up the standalone microSD image to automatically flash the eMMC on powerup. Login as debian (password = temppwd) and edit /boot/uEnv.txt with nano (sudo nano /boot/uEnv.txt) or your preferred editor.

In /boot/uEnv.txt:

##enable BBB: eMMC Flasher:
#cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh
Change to:

##enable BBB: eMMC Flasher:
cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh
Optional, update Flasher Scripts:

cd /opt/scripts/
git pull
and reboot the system, it'll flash the eMMC on the next bootup. (make sure to remove the microSD after flashing is complete, otherwise it'll just keep on re-flashing the eMMC)
