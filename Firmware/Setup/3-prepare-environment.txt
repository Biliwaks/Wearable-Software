1. To prepare the environment on the BBGW, first update your board
>> sudo apt-get update

2. To make run the code on the BBB, you need to set up some tools. Make sure those tools are installed and updated:
- python/pip: To run code (Usually preinstalled, just needs to be updated) [IMPORTANT: Not running on python3 for now!!!]
- git: To get the code (Usually preinstalled, just needs to be updated)
- mraa: To access low-level hardware and add it to PYTHONPATH (Preinstalled on provided image, otherwise needs to be downloaded and build on board)
